Original Image:
Display the original image before applying the K-means clustering.

Segmented Image:
Show the image after performing K-means clustering. This image will have the original colors replaced with the cluster center colors.

Color Palette:
Create a color palette by displaying the colors of the cluster centers. This will help visualize the dominant colors extracted from the image.

Masked Image:
Show the final result after applying a mask to the segmented image. The masked image will have only a specific cluster (color) enabled, while others will be set to black.

Cluster Distribution:
Display a bar plot or pie chart showing the distribution of pixels among different clusters. This will give an overview of how the image is divided into different color clusters.

Cluster Centroids:
Show the cluster centroids as individual color patches. This visualization can help understand the specific colors that represent each cluster.

Clustered Pixels:
Create a scatter plot where each pixel is represented by a point colored according to its cluster assignment. This can provide a visual representation of how pixels are grouped together based on color similarity.

Color Histogram:
Generate a histogram showing the frequency of different colors in the segmented image. This can help analyze the color distribution and identify dominant colors.
